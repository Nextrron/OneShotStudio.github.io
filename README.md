#The studio:
We are a big group of kids who like to learn and create. We all love to help others no matter who they are. We want to do this. Not all of us do, But some of us. We love technology, history, math, science, and many other subjects. If you want to join, go down to the "Joining" section.
#Us:
Me, I am a kid. Yes I am writing this. I love to do anything to help. Whether it's coding, designing, writing, and many others. The reason I am writing this instead of a teacher or something is  because of my passion. I want to do most of this site my self. I do work in small groups though.
